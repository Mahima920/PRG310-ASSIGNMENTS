# How DevOps Improves Software Delivery

DevOps is a cultural and technical practice that improves how teams build, test, and release software. It brings development and operations together, focusing on collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery.

With DevOps, companies can:

Deliver software faster and more reliably
Catch bugs early using automated testing
Make frequent updates without breaking systems
Collaborate better between teams
Real companies like Netflix and Amazon use DevOps to push updates multiple times a day while maintaining uptime and customer satisfaction.
