# How DevOps Improves Software Delivery

DevOps is a cultural and technical practice that improves how teams build, test, and release software. It brings development and operations together, focusing on collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery.

With DevOps, companies can:

- Deliver software faster and more reliably
- Catch bugs early using automated testing
- Make frequent updates without breaking systems
- Collaborate better between teams

Companies like Netflix and Amazon use DevOps to release updates multiple times a day while keeping customer satisfaction high.
